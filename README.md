# Local AI Presentation Agent

A local presentation generator that asks Ollama for a structured slide plan and
turns that plan into an editable PowerPoint presentation with the Knowledge
Foundation visual system reconstructed from the supplied PDF template.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Ollama running locally
- An installed Ollama model (development default: `qwen3.5:9b`)

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run

Browser interface:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit will print a local URL and normally open it in your browser. Enter a
request, choose the audience and slide count, then download the generated
PowerPoint from the page.

Command-line interface:

Interactive mode:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or pass the request directly:

```bash
python main.py "Create a 5-slide presentation explaining quantum computing to first-year university students."
```

The generated `.pptx` is saved in `output/`. The model name and Ollama host are
read from environment variables; application code does not hard-code a model.

## Test

```bash
pytest
```

## Current scope

This first working version supports title, agenda, content, section, quote, and
closing slides. It validates the structured model response and checks the
resulting PowerPoint package for basic layout and content problems. Web research,
automatic citations, advanced charts, and iterative slide repair are deliberately
left for later work.
